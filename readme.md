## Description

Polylang Translate existing media is an add-on for the multilingual WordPress plugin [Polylang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/). This add-on let's you bulk translate and replace all existing media in content, featured image and meta fields you enable translations in media. This plugin is based on my other Polylang plugin [polylang-copy-content](https://github.com/aucor/polylang-copy-content).

When to use:

 * When turning existing site to multi-lingual
 * When enabling media translations when you already have media uploaded and added to content


Basic feature list:

 * Translate all media (images and galleries) that are inside content, meta fields and featured image
 * Takes care all post types (that are not 'attachment', 'revision', 'acf-field', 'acf-field-group', 'nav_menu_item', 'polylang_mo')
 * Image translations are linked automatically
 * You can add your own custom fields that have image IDs
 * Uses Polylang's functions, no messing around

**This is open source and I cannot give you any guarantees, though it has worked for me in many projects. Please, report issues and contribute!**


## Installation

How-to use (takes around 5 minutes):

 * Take a backup of your database
 * Download plugin and activate (you will need Polylang active)
 * Enable Media translations in Polylang Settings
 * Set all content without language to default language from "Languages" admin page
 * Click "1. Translate the whole media library" from the admin notice
 * Click through steps (50 posts at a time). Each step will take some time.
 * Click "2. Translate existing images in content" from the admin notice
 * Click through steps (50 posts at a time). Each step will take some time.

## Filters

**Add your own custom fields that have images saved as IDs:**

```
function prefix_custom_fields_to_translate($custom_fields) {
	// return keys of your custom fields with image id
  return array(
    'my_custom_image_field',
    'other_custom_image_field'
  );
}
add_filter( 'polylang-translate-existing-media-custom-fields-with-image-id', 'prefix_custom_fields_to_translate' );
